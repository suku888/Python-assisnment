        "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable is categorical and typically takes one of two values (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1, True/False). It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category by applying the logistic (sigmoid) function to a linear combination of the input variables. The output is always between 0 and 1, representing a probability.\n",

        "The Sigmoid function plays a crucial role in Logistic Regression by converting the linear output of the model into a probability value between 0 and 1. The mathematical form of the sigmoid function is:\n",

        "Probability Mapping: The sigmoid function takes the raw output of the linear equation and maps it to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the input belonging to the positive class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification: A threshold (commonly 0.5) is applied to the sigmoid output to make the final classification. If the output is ≥ 0.5, the input is classified as class 1; otherwise, it is class 0.\n",

The sigmoid function enables logistic regression to model classification problems effectively by translating outputs into probabilities.\n"

        "Regularization in Logistic Regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. Overfitting occurs when the model learns noise and random fluctuations in the training data, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Regularization discourages the model from assigning excessively large weights to features, thus improving generalization.\n",
